ABOUTME: A journal entry from card #30: The lint arrived after the binding documents, and they barely cleared it

## 2026-09-22 — The lint arrived after the binding documents, and they barely cleared it

Writing `spec-style-lint` against documents already written showed how little headroom the
sentence ceiling has: the longest sentence the lint reads is 39 words against a ceiling of 40.
The next compound sentence anyone writes into the README or the register reds the build.

Two of the four register rules turned out to be unlintable, and the reason is worth keeping.
Rule 3 asks whether an actor is genuinely unknown and rule 4 asks whether a structure fits its
meaning. Both are judgments about intent, and a lint that guessed at either would file findings
an author has to argue with rather than fix.

The sentence splitter asks the word after a full stop whether the stop ended a sentence, and it
is wrong both ways. A lowercase word keeps two sentences joined, as `v0 buys` does, and the
count comes out high. A capital after an abbreviation splits one sentence into two, the way
`e.g. Rigger` does, and the count comes out low.

The second of those cost a review round, because this entry first claimed it could not happen.
A bias in a check is worth disclosing, and a bias described as absent is worse than one nobody
mentioned: a reader then draws a conclusion the check cannot support. A green lint says no
sentence the splitter reads is past the ceiling, which is narrower than it sounds.
