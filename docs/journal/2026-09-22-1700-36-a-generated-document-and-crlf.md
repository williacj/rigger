ABOUTME: A journal entry from card #36: A generated document and CRLF

## 2026-09-22 — A generated document and CRLF

The test matrix is compared with what its tool writes, byte for byte. Git hands a Windows
working tree CRLF and the tool writes LF, so on Windows the check called a freshly written file
stale. `.gitattributes` pins `docs/derived/` to LF, the way it already pins the hooks. Any
generated document that lands there inherits the pin.
