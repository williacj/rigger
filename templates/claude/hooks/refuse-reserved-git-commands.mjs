// Bash owns what a here-document is. This is a copy of the part of that rule the gate needs, so

//
// A `<<` opens a here-document only where bash reads a command's words, and only where a
// redirection may begin. Skipping a body is the gate choosing not to read text, so a `<<` this
// lexer honours and bash ignores skips commands bash goes on to run — which is why the notion of
// where one can open must not exceed bash's. Bash reads no command word inside a quoted string,
// a comment, an arithmetic expression, a parameter expansion or a backtick substitution. The
// first, second, third and fifth the lexer takes whole. The fourth, and `$[ ]` with it, are not
// modelled: instead this gate honours a `<<` only where the word being read is empty or is the
// file descriptor it redirects, which places a `<<` inside any word-internal construct out of
// reach without modelling any of them. That list was taken from bash by running it, and `[[ ]]`
// and a `case` pattern are absent from it because bash rejects a `<<` in either.
//
// That placement rule is narrower than bash's, which is a cost rather than a claim about bash:
// bash ends a word at `<` and `>`, so it begins a redirection straight after another
// redirection's target, and `cat >out<<EOF` is a here-document to bash and unreadable here. It is
// kept narrow deliberately. Honouring a `<<` because its word began with a redirection would
// honour `echo >${x:-<<W}` too, where bash reads no redirection at all and runs what follows —
// measured, and the reason the rule is not widened to the target.
//
// Where the copy still disagrees, it refuses:
//   - A body bash would end at end of input. Bash warns and runs the command; a permission
//     decision has no warning to give, and the alternative is skipping to the end of the text.
//   - A `<<` this gate cannot place: inside a word, as in `cat foo<<EOF`, `a=1<<EOF` and
//     `let x=1<<EOF`, and directly after a redirection, as in `cat >out<<EOF` and `cat <<A<<B`.
//     Bash makes every one of those a here-document. The gate cannot tell them apart from a `<<`
//     inside a construct of that word, so all of them are unreadable here.
//   - `$( (subshell) )`, whose first `)` this lexer pairs with the `$(`. Nothing is skipped.
//
// And one disagreement it does not settle by refusing, because it never did: the gate reads
// inside no command substitution and no subshell as commands, so `$(git push --force)`, its
// backtick spelling, and `( git push --force )` are all permitted and all run. That predates this
// lexer, is card #84, and nothing here widens or narrows it.

/**
 * Programs that run a command named in their arguments. Stepping over one is not enough, because
 * each has its own options and some take an operand before the command — `timeout 5 git …`,
 * `nice -n 10 git …`, `env -u FOO git …`. Rather than carry an option grammar per program, every
 * word after the prefix is read as a possible start of a command.
 *
 * That reads more words than bash runs, which can only add a refusal: it objects only where the
 * words from one of them on spell a reserved command, so `nohup echo git status` and
 * `command -v git` are untouched while `nohup git push --force` is refused. What it costs is a
 * command whose arguments spell a reserved git command that bash passes to something else, as
 * `nohup echo git push --force` does.
 *
 * `env` was the one name here before this list, and stepping over it was defeated by its own
 * options. These are programs rather than shell grammar, so which of them exists is a fact about
 * the host: a name absent from the host runs nothing, and the pull request records which were
 * watched running git here and which bash reported absent.
